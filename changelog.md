# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
Funcky adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Funcky 3.5.0 | Funcky.Async 1.4.0 | Funcky.Xunit 2.1.0 | Funcky.Analyzers 1.4.0
This update is mainly to update to .NET 9 but also has several smaller improvements.

### .NET 9
Thanks to the new `[OverloadResolutionPriority]` attribute, we've been able finally fix
the ambiguous call errors when using `DictionaryExtensions.GetValueOrNone`:

```csharp
Dictionary<string, string> favouriteFoods = new();
Option<int> tausFavouriteFood = favouriteFoods.GetValueOrNone("Tau");
//                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// This used to produce a `error CS0121: The call is ambiguous between ...` error
// and now simply works 🎉
```

In good old fashion, we've also added new parse extensions:
* `ParseExtensions.ParseAssemblyNameInfoOrNone`
* `ParseExtensions.ParseTypeNameOrNone`

### Policy for EOL Target Frameworks
We've [explicitly written down](SupportPolicy.md) our policy for how we deal
with older / EOL target frameworks.

In short: EOL target frameworks are supported by Funcky until the next major version.
However, we may no longer test Funcky against those target frameworks, so we
can't guarantee that everything works smoothly.

## New APIs
In Funcky 3.0 we've changed `CycleRange` and `RepeatRange` to return an `IBuffer`
to enable us to memoize the collection, preventing unnecessary enumeration. This however
is unpractical for uses where you want to cycle an already materialized collection.
This release adds two new methods to accommodate that use case:
`CycleMaterialized` and `RepeatMaterialized`.

For convenient downcasting of `Option<T>`, `Result<T>` and `Either<TLeft, T>` values, we've added a new
`DownCast` class:

```csharp
Option<object> option = Option.Some("hello world");
Option<string> downcasted = DownCast<string>.From(option);
```

### Funcky.XUnit
`Funcky.XUnit` has been updated to the latest version (2.9.3) of xUnit.net.

Due to changes in xUnit we've had to change the exception type thrown by our `FunctionalAssert` methods
from `AssertActualExpectedException` to `XunitException`.

### Funcky.Analyzers
The new analyzer rule `λ1009` prevents you from accidentally `default`-instantiating
`Either`, `Result` and `EitherOrBoth`.

### Funcky.Async
The `PowerSet` and `WithPrevious` extensions now correctly pass along the cancellation token.


## Funcky 3.4.0 | Funcky.Async 1.3.0 | Funcky.XUnit 2.0.2

This update is mainly to update to .NET 8 but also has several smaller improvements.

### Native AOT

Both Funcky and Funcky.Async have been annotated to be compatible with [Native AOT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot).
The only exception is `OptionJsonSerializer` which is not compatible with Native AOT.

### .NET 8

We use the new C#12 and .NET features in the code, and expose new features through our API.

* .NET 8 added new overloads to their `TryParse` APIs. These changes  are reflected in Funcky's `ParseOrNone` APIs.
  * `ParseByteOrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` and `string?`
  * `ParseSByteOrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseSingleOrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseDoubleOrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseDecimalOrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseInt16OrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseInt32OrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseInt64OrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseUInt16OrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseUInt32OrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseUInt64OrNone` overloads with `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`
  * `ParseNumberOrNone<TNumber>` overloads
  * `ParseOrNone<TParsable>` overloads

### String Extensions

We implemented a few of the IEnumerable extensions which are very useful on strings.

* `Chunk` on `string`.
* `SlidingWindow` on `string`.

### Monads

* Implemented `UpCast` for the monds `Option`, `Either`, `Result` and `System.Lazy`.
* Implemented `InspectEmpty` on `IEnumerable` and `IAsyncEnumerable`
* Implemented `ToAsyncEnumerable` extension on `Option`

### IEnumerator

* `MoveNextOrNone` extension on `IEnumerator<T>`

### Consistency

* `FindIndexOrNone` and `FindLastIndexOrNone` extensions on `List`


## Funcky 3.3.0 | Funcky.Analyzers 1.3.0 | Funcky.Xunit 2.0.1
This is a relatively minor release focuses on convenience for our monads `Option`, `Either` and `Result`.

### `GetOrElse` and `OrElse` for all
We've added `GetOrElse` and `OrElse` to `Either` and `Result` bringing them on par with `Option`. \
The corresponding analyzer now also correctly suggests using these methods instead of `Match` for `Result` and `Either`.

### `Inspect` for the error case
All three alternative monads `Option`, `Either` and `Result` now support inspecting the «error» case:
* `Option.InspectNone` - executes a side effect only when the option is `None`.
* `Either.InspectLeft` - executes a side effect only when the either is on the `Left` side.
* `Result.InspectError` - executes a side effect only when the result is an `Error`.

These methods are particularly useful for logging warnings/errors.

### Funcky.XUnit

* Funcky.XUnit is only compatible with XUnit 2.4, this is now correctly declared.

## Funcky 3.2.0 | Funcky.Async 1.2.0
### List Pattern for Option
We've added support for C# 11's List Patterns to `Option<T>`.
This means that you can use regular `switch` expressions / statements to match on options:

```cs
var greeting = person switch
{
    { FirstName: var firstName, LastName: [var lastName] } => $"Hello {firstName} {lastName}",
    { FirstName: var firstName } => $"Hi {firstName}",
};

record Person(string FirstName, Option<string> LastName);
```

### Discard
The new `Discard.__` field provides a short-hand for `Unit.Value` to be used with `switch` expressions.

```cs
using static Funcky.Discard;

return __ switch
{
    _ when user.IsFrenchAdmin() => "le sécret",
    _ when user.IsAdmin() => "secret",
    _ => "(redacted)",
};
```

### Retry with Exception
We've added overloads to the `Retry` and `RetryAsync` functions that allow retrying a function
as long as an exception is thrown.

Example from [`IoRetrier`](https://github.com/messerli-informatik-ag/io/blob/main/IO/Retrier.cs):
```cs
// Retries an action until the file is no longer in use.
Task RetryWhileFileIsInUseAsync(IRetryPolicy policy, Action action)
    => RetryAsync(ActionToUnit(action), exception => exception is IOException && exception.HResult == FileInUseHResult, policy);
```

### New Extensions
* `EnumerableExtensions.MinByOrNone`
* `EnumerableExtensions.MaxByOrNone`
* `ImmutableListExtensions.IndexOfOrNone`
* `ImmutableListExtensions.LastIndexOfOrNone`
* `ListExtensions.IndexOfOrNone`

## Funcky 3.1.0 | Funcky.Async 1.1.0 | Funcky.Analyzers 1.2.0
### New APIs
* ✨ `OptionExtensions.ToNullable` ✨
* `StreamExtenions.ReadByteOrNone`
* New overloads for `ElementAtOrNone` that take an `Index`.
* New overload for `JoinToString` that takes an `IEnumerable<string>`.

### .NET 7
* .NET 7 added new overloads to their `TryParse` APIs. These changes
   are reflected in Funcky's `ParseOrNone` APIs.
* The `ParseOrNone` methods include the new `[StringSyntax]` attribute from .NET 7.

### Analyzers
The new `Option.Match` analyzer suggests simpler alternatives over custom `Match`es including
the all-new `ToNullable` extension.

## Funcky 3.0.0 | Funcky.Async 1.0.0 | Funcky.XUnit 2.0.0
There's a handy [Migration Guide](https://polyadic.github.io/funcky/migration-guide.html) available.

### New APIs
* `Result.GetOrThrow`
* `EnumerableExtensions.GetNonEnumeratedCountOrNone`

#### `PriorityQueue`
* `PriorityQueueExtensions.DequeueOrNone`
* `PeekOrNone`

#### Traversable
The new `Traverse` and `Sequence` extension methods allow you to
«swap» the inner and outer monad (e.g. `Result<Option<T>>` -> `Option<Result<T>>`)

#### `Memoize`
The new `Memoize` extension function returns an `IBuffer` / `IAsyncBuffer`. \
This new type represents ownership over the underlying enumerator (and is therefore `IDisposable`).

`CycleRange` and `RepeatRange` have also been changed to return an `IBuffer`.

### `ParseExtensions`
The parse extensions have been improved with the goal of aligning more with the BCL.
Many of the changes are breaking.

* The functions now use BCL type names instead of C# type names
  (e.g. `ParseIntOrNone` has been renamed to `Parse`)
* The parameter names and nullability have been changed to align with the BCL.
* Added `HttpHeadersNonValidatedExtensions`

### `IReadOnlyList` / `IReadOnlyCollection`
Funcky now communicates materialization in the `IEnumerable<T>` extensions by returning
`IReadOnlyList` or `IReadOnlyCollection`. This reduces «multiple enumeration» warnings.

* `Materialize`
* `Chunk`
* `Partition`
* `Shuffle`
* `SlidingWindow`
* `Split`
* `Transpose`
* `Sequence.Return`

### Disallowing `null` Values
Our `Option<T>` type has always disallowed `null` values.
This has been extended to our other monads: `Result<T>`, `Either<L, R>` and `Reader<E, R>`.

### Breaking Changes
* `Option.None()` has been changed to a property. There's an automatic fix available for this.
* Our `Match` functions now differentiate between `Func` and `Action`.
  The `Action` overloads have been renamed to `Switch`.
* The return type of `EnumerableExtensions.ForEach` has been changed to `Unit`.
* Many parameter names and generic type names have been renamed in an attempt to unify naming across Funcky.
* All `Action` extensions have been moved to a new class `ActionExtensions`.
* `EitherOrBoth` has been moved to the `Funcky` namespace.
* The retry policies have been moved to the `Funcky.RetryPolicies` namespace.
* `Partition` returns a custom `Partitions` struct instead of a tuple.

#### Obsoleted APIs Removed
APIs that have been obsoleted during 2.x have been removed:

* `ObjectExtensions.ToEnumerable`
* `Funcky.GenericConstraints.RequireClass` and `RequireStruct`
* All `Try*` APIs (`TryGetValue`, `TryParse*`, etc.). These APIs use the `OrNone` suffix instead.
* `Sequence.Generate` has been superceded by `Sequence.Successors`
* `CartesianProduct`

#### JSON Converter
We have removed the implicit `System.Text.Json` converter for `Option<T>`.
This means that you'll have to register the `OptionJsonConverter` yourself. \
⚠️ Test this change carefully as you won't get an error during compilation, but rather at runtime.

#### Moved to Funcky.Async
All APIs related to `IAsyncEnumerable` and `Task` have been moved to the new `Funcky.Async` package:

* `AsyncEnumerableExtensions`
* `Functional.RetryAsync` -> `AsyncFunctional.RetryAsync`
* `Option<Task>` and `Option<ValueTask>` awaiters

### Funcky.Async
#### `AsyncSequence`
This class exposes all of the same factory functions as `Sequence`, but for `IAsyncEnumerable`:
* `Return`
* `Successors`
* `Concat`
* `Cycle`
* `CycleRange`
* `FromNullable`
* `RepeatRange`

#### New `IAsyncEnumerable` extensions
We've worked hard towards the goal of parity between our extensions for `IEnumerable` and `IAsyncEnumerable`:

* `AdjacentGroupBy`
* `AnyOrElse`
* `AverageOrNoneAsync` / `MaxOrNoneAsync` / `MinOrNoneAsync`
* `Chunk`
* `ConcatToStringAsync`
* `ExclusiveScan`
* `InclusiveScan`
* `Inspect`
* `Interleave`
* `Intersperse`
* `JoinToStringAsync`
* `MaterializeAsync`
* `Memoize`
* `Merge`
* `NoneAsync`
* `PartitionAsync`
* `PowerSet`
* `Sequence` / `SequenceAsync` / `Traverse` / `TraverseAsync`
* `ShuffleAsync`
* `SlidingWindow`
* `Split`
* `Transpose`
* `WhereNotNull`
* `WithIndex` / `WithLast` / `WithPrevious` / `WithFirst`
* `ZipLongest`

### Funcky.Xunit
* Breaking: The `Is` prefix has been dropped from assertion methods for consistency with
XUnit's naming scheme for assertion methods.

## Funcky 2.7.1
### Deprecations
* `Option.None<T>()`: We originally introduced the `Option.None<T>` method as a future proof replacement to `Option<T>.None` for use in method groups,
  because Funcky 3 changes `Option<T>.None` to a property. This turned out to be confusing to users especially because both method are always suggested in autocomplete.

## Funcky 2.7.0 | Funcky.XUnit 1.0.0 | Funcky.Analyzers 1.1.0
This release is the last non-breaking release for Funcky before 3.0.

### Deprecations
* `EnumerableExtensions.CartesianProduct` will be removed in Funcky 3.
* To align our naming with that of the BCL, the `ParseOrNone` methods
  that return a type that has a keyword in C# `int`, `long`, etc. use the name of the BCL type instead. \
  Example: `ParseIntOrNone` becomes `ParseInt32OrNone`. \
  The old methods will be removed in Funcky 3.
* In preparation for Funcky 3 we deprecated `Option<T>.None` when used as method group. Use `Option.None<T>` instead.

### New `ParseOrNone` extensions
With the help of a source generator we have added a lot of new ParseOrNone methods for various types from the BCL:
  * Unsigned integer types
  * `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`
  * `Version`
  * Support for `ReadOnlySpan<T>` as input
  * ... and more

### Convenience for `Either` and `Result`
* Added implicit conversions for `Either` and `Result`.
* Implement `Inspect` for `Either` and `Result`.
* Added `Partition` for `IEnumerable<Either>` and `IEnumerable<Result>`.
* Added `ToString` on `Either` and `Result`.
* Implement `ToEither` on `Option`.

### `IEnumerable<T>` extensions
* `AnyOrElse`
* Prefix sum: `InclusiveScan` and `ExclusiveScan`

### Analyzers
This release adds two new analyzer rules:

* λ1003: Warning when certain methods, such as `Match` are used without argument labels
* λ1004: Warning that suggests `.ConcatToString()` over `.JoinToString("")`

Both of these warnings come with corresponding code fixes.

### Funcky.Xunit
* Breaking: Funcky.Xunit now uses the `Funcky` namespace, instead of `Funcky.Xunit`.
* Add assertion methods for testing `Either`: `FunctionalAssert.IsLeft` and `FunctionalAssert.IsRight`.

## Funcky 2.6.0 | Funcky.Analyzers 1.0.0
### Analyzers
This release comes with a new package `Funcky.Analyzers`, which we'll use
to guide users of Funcky

### New extensions
* Add extensions `DequeueOrNone` and `PeekOrNone` on `Queue` and `ConcurrentQueue`.
* Add extension `ConcatToString` as an alias for `string.Concat`.
* Add overload to `WhereSelect` with no parameter.
* Add methods to convert from `Either` to `Option`: [#439](https://github.com/polyadic/funcky/issues/439)
    * `LeftOrNone`: Returns the left value or `None` if the either value was right.
    * `RightOrNone`: Returns the right value or `None` if the either value was left.
* Extension functions for `System.Range` to allow the generations of `IEnumerable<T>`s from Range-Syntax:
  ```cs
  foreach(var i in 1..5) { }

  // negative numbers are not supported
  from x in 5..2
  from y in 1..3
  select (x, y)
  ```

### Improvements to `Sequence`
* `Sequence.Return` now accepts multiple parameters:
  ```cs
  Sequence.Return(1, 2, 3)
  ```
* ⚠️ `Sequence.Generate` has been deprecated in favour of the newly added `Sequence.Successors` function
  which includes the first element (seed) in the generated sequence.

### Improvements to `Option`
* Add `Option.FromBoolean` to create an `Option<T>` from a boolean.

### Improvements to `Result`
The behaviour of the `Result.Error` constructor has been changed regarding exceptions
with an already set stack trace. The original stack trace is now preserved.
Previously this resulted in the stacktrace being replaced (.NET < 5.0) or an error (.NET ≥ 5.0).

### Improvements to `Either`
* Add `Either.Flip` to swaps left with right.

### Tooling
* Funcky automatically adds global usings for the most important namespaces of funcky
  when the `FunckyImplicitUsings` property is set. This requires .NET SDK ≥ 6.0 and C# ≥ 10.0.
* Funcky now supports [trimming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained) for self-contained deployments.
* `Option<T>` now works with the new [System.Text.Json source generation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-source-generation?pivots=dotnet-6-0).
* The `Funcky` package now supports [Source Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink) and deterministic builds.
* The symbols package is now finally working again.

## Funcky 2.5.0
### Reader Monad
This release includes the `Reader` monad including a bunch of factory methods
and convenience extensions.

```cs
public static Reader<Enviroment, IEnumerable<string>> DefaultLayout(IEnumerable<DateTime> month)
    => from colorizedMonthName in ColorizedMonthName(month)
       from weekDayLine in WeekDayLine()
       from weeksInMonth in month
        .GroupBy(GetWeekOfYear)
        .Select(FormatWeek)
        .Sequence()
       select BuildDefaultLayout(colorizedMonthName, weekDayLine, weeksInMonth);
```

### Improved `Action` Extensions
Funcky now supports `Curry`, `Uncurry` and `Flip` for `Action`s too. \
This release also adds the inversion of `ActionToUnit`: `UnitToAction`

### More Extensions for `IEnumerable<T>`
* `Intersperse`: Adds a given item in between all items of an enumerable.
* `JoinToString`: Alias for `string.Join`.
* `WithPrevious`: Similar to `WithFirst/Last/Index` but with the predecessor of each item.
* `ForEach`: Add an overload to `ForEach` that accepts a `Unit`-returning `Func`.

### Additional Factory Methods
* `EitherOrBoth.FromOptions` creates an `EitherOrBoth` from two options.
* `Lazy.FromFunc` creates a `Lazy<T>` from a `Func`. \
   This is sugar over the `Lazy<T>` constructor, with the additional benefit of supporting type inference.
* `Lazy.Return` creates a `Lazy<T>` from a value. \
  This is sugar over the `Lazy<T>` constructor, with the additional benefit of supporting type inference.

### Documentation Improvements
This release comes with a few small documentation improvements.
Funcky users will now also see the `[Pure]` attributes which were previously not emitted.

## Funcky 2.4.1
* Remove upper bounds on all Microsoft.Bcl.\* dependencies.
  Between the 2.3.0 and 2.4.0 release an overly restrictive upper bound was accidentally introduced for Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces.

## Funcky 2.4.0
### `Try*` → `*OrNone`
We've renamed all `Try*` methods, such as `TryParse`, `TryGet` value to `*OrNone`.
The old methods are still available, but marked as obsolete and will be removed in 3.0.0.

### Factory methods for `IEnumerable<T>`
This release adds some new factory methods for creating `IEnumerable<T>`
to the `Sequence` class:
* `Sequence.RepeatRange`: Generates a sequence that contains the same sequence of elements the given number of times
* `Sequence.Cycle`: Cycles the same element over and over again as an endless generator.
* `Sequence.CycleRange`: Generates a sequence that contains the same sequence of elements over and over again as an endless generator
* `Sequence.Concat`

### More Extension Methods
#### for `IEnumerable<T>`
  * `Materialize`: Materializes all the items of a lazy enumerable.
  * `PowerSet`: Returns a sequence with the set of all subsets
  * `Shuffle`: Returns the given sequence in random Order in O(n).
  * `Split`: Splits the source sequence a separator.
  * `ZipLongest`: Zips two sequences with different lengths.
#### for `string`
* `SplitLazy`: Splits a string by separator lazily.
* `SplitLines`: Splits a string by newline lazily.
#### for `Func`
* `Curry`
* `Uncurry`
* `Flip`
* `Compose`

### `EitherOrBoth`
EitherOrBoth is a new data type that can represent `Left`, `Right` and `Both`. It is used in `ZipLongest`.

### `Monad.Return`
This release adds a `Return` method for all monad types in Funcky:
* `Option.Return`
* `Either<TLeft>.Return`
* `Result.Return`

### `OptionEqualityComparer`
To support more advanced comparison scenarios, `OptionEqualityComparer` has been added similar to the already existing `OptionComparer`.

### Smaller Improvements
* Added a missing `Match` overload to `Either` that takes `Action`s
* Added additional overloads for `Functional.True` and `Functional.False` for up to four parameters.

## Funcky 2.3.0
* `net5.0` has been added to Funcky's target frameworks.

### Improvements to `Option<T>`
* `Option<T>` is now implicitly convertible from `T`.
  ```csharp
  public static Option<int> Answer => 42;
  ```
* `Option` adds support for `System.Text.Json`:\
  The custom `JsonConverter` is picked up automatically when serializing/deserializing.
  `None` is serialized as `null` and `Some(value)` is serialized to whatever `value` serializes to.

### Factory methods for `IEnumerable<T>`
This release adds factory methods for creating `IEnumerable<T>`
with the static class `Sequence`:
* `Sequence.Return`: Creates an `IEnumerable<T>` with exactly one item.
* `Sequence.FromNullable`: Creates an `IEnumerable<T>` with zero or one items.
* `Sequence.Generate`: Creates an `IEnumerable<T>` using a generation function and a seed.

### More Extension Methods for `IEnumerable<T>`
This release adds a bunch of new extension methods on `IEnumerable<T>`:
* `AdjacentGroupBy`
* `AverageOrNone`
* `CartesianProduct`
* `Chunk`
* `ElementAtOrNone`
* `Interleave`
* `MaxOrNone`
* `Merge`
* `MinOrNone`
* `Pairwise`
* `Partition`
* `SlidingWindow`
* `TakeEvery`
* `Transpose`
* `WithFirst`
* `WithIndex`
* `WithLast`

### `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` Support
This release adds a couple of extension methods that provide interoperability
with `Option<T>` to `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`:
* `WhereSelect`
* `FirstOrNoneAsync`
* `LastOrNoneAsync`
* `SingleOrNoneAsync`
* `ElementAtOrNoneAsync`

A couple of the new extension methods on `IEnumerable<T>` have async counterparts:
* `Pairwise`
* `TakeEvery`

The naming of the extension methods and their overloads follows that of [`System.Linq.Async`](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive/tree/main/Ix.NET/Source/System.Linq.Async).

### Improved `IQueryable` Support
This release adds specialized extension methods for `IQueryable<T>` that are better
suited especially for use with EF Core:
* `FirstOrNone`
* `LastOrNone`
* `SingleOrNone`

### Dependencies
To support .NET Standard, Funcky conditionally pulls in dependencies
that provide the missing functionality:
* `Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces` for .NET Standard 2.0
* `System.Collections.Immutable` and `System.Text.Json` for .NET Standard 2.0 and 2.1
* The version constraints for all these packages have been relaxed to allow 5.x.

### Improvements
* `ConfigureAwait(false)` is now used everywhere `await` is used.
* The `IRetryPolicy` implementations now use correct `Timespan` with `double` multiplication
  when targeting .NET Standard 2.0.

### Deprecations
* `ObjectExtensions.ToEnumerable` has been deprecated in favor of `Sequence.FromNullable`.
* `RequireClass` and `RequireStruct` have been obsoleted with no replacement.

## Funcky 2.2.0 | Funcky.xUnit 0.1.3
* Added overload to `Functional.Retry` with a `IRetryPolicy`.
* Added `None` overload that takes no predicate.

## Funcky 2.1.1 | Funcky.xUnit 0.1.2
* Re-release of previous release with correct assemblies.

## Funcky 2.1.0 | Funcky.xUnit 0.1.1
* Add `Inspect` method to `Option` akin to `IEnumerable.Inspect`.
* Add `ToTheoryData` extension for `IEnumerable<T>` for xUnit.
* Add `Unit.Value` as a way to a get a `Unit` value.
* Add `Functional.Retry` which retries a producer until `Option.Some` is returned.

## Funcky 2.0.0
### Breaking Changes
* Remove `Reader` monad based on `await`.
* Remove `IToString`.
* Remove overload for `Option.From` that flattens passed `Option`s.
* Move `ToEnumerable` extension method to its own class.
  This is only a breaking change if you've used the extension method as normal method.
  In that case you need to change `EnumerableExtensions.ToEnumerable` to `ObjectExtensions.ToEnumerable`.
* Rename `Option.From` to `Option.FromNullable` and remove overload that takes non-nullable value types.
* Unify `Option<T>.ToEnumerable` and `Yield` to `ToEnumerable`
* Rename `OrElse` overloads that return the item to `GetOrElse` which improves overload resolution.
* The `Each` extension method on `IEnumerable<T>` has been renamed to `ForEach`.
* Move the `Ok` constructor of `Result<T>` to a non-generic class. This allows for the compiler to infer the generic type.
  Old: `Result<int>.Ok(10)`. New: `Result.Ok(10)`.
* Use `Func<T, bool>` instead of `Predicate<T>` in predicate composition functions (`Functional.All`, `Functional.Any`, `Functional.Not`),
  because most APIs in `System` use `Func`.
* `Functional.Any` now returns `false` when the given list of predicates is empty.

### Fixes
* Fix incorrect `Equals` implementation on `Option`.
  `Equals` previously returned `true` when comparing a `None` value with a `Some` value containing the default value of the type.
* `Exception` created by `Result` monad contains valid stack trace
* Fix incorrect implementation on `Result.SelectMany` which called the `selectedResultSelector` even when the
  result was an error. As a result (pun intended) of the fix, `ResultCombinationException` is no longer needed and also removed.

### Additions
* Add `IndexOfOrNone`, `LastIndexOfOrNone`, `IndexOfAnyOrNone` and `LastIndexOfAnyOrNone` extension methods to `string`.
* Added `Curry`, `Uncurry` and `Flip` to the `Functional` Class
* Add extension method for `HttpHeaders.TryGetValues`, which returns an `Option`.
* Add extension methods for getting `Stream` properties that are not always available, as `Option`:
  `GetLengthOrNone`, `GetPositionOrNone`, `GetReadTimeoutOrNone`, `GetWriteTimeoutOrNone`.
* Add `None` extension method to `IEnumerable`.
* `Option<Task<T>>`, `Option<Task>` and their `ValueTask` equivalents are now awaitable:
  ```csharp
  var answer = await Option.Some(Task.FromResult(42));
  ```

### Improvements
* Full nullable support introduced with C# 8.
* Mark our functions as `[Pure]`.
* Implement `IEquatable` on `Option`, `Result` and `Either`.

## Funcky 2.0.0-rc.2
* Move the `Ok` constructor of `Result<T>` to a non-generic class. This allows for the compiler to infer the generic type.
  Old: `Result<int>.Ok(10)`. New: `Result.Ok(10)`.
* Add `IndexOfOrNone`, `LastIndexOfOrNone`, `IndexOfAnyOrNone` and `LastIndexOfAnyOrNone` extension methods to `string`.
* Rename `OrElse` overloads that return the item to `GetOrElse` which improves overload resolution.
* Added `Curry`, `Uncurry` and `Flip` to the `Functional` Class
* Remove `IToString`.
* Mark our functions as `[Pure]`.
* Fix incorrect implementation on `Result.SelectMany` which called the `selectedResultSelector` even when the
  result was an error. As a result (pun intended) of the fix, `ResultCombinationException` is no longer needed and also removed.

## Funcky 2.0.0-rc.1
* Full nullable support introduced with C# 8
* Rename `Option.From` -> `Option.FromNullable` and remove overload that takes non-nullable value types.
* Use `Func<T, bool>` instead of `Predicate<T>` in predicate composition functions (`Functional.All`, `Functional.Any`, `Functional.Not`),
  because most APIs in `System` use `Func`.
* `Functional.Any` now returns `false` when the given list of predicates is empty.
* The `Each` extension method on `IEnumerable<T>` has been renamed to `ForEach`.
* Unify `Option<T>.ToEnumerable` and `Yield` to `ToEnumerable`
* Remove `Reader` monad based on `await`.
* `Exception` created by `Result` monad contains valid stack trace

## Funcky 1.8.0
* Added overload for `AndThen` which flattens the `Option`
* Add `Where` method to `Option<T>`, which allows filtering the `Option` by a predicate.
* Add overload for `Option<T>.SelectMany` that takes only a selector.
* Add `WhereNotNull` extension method for `IEnumerable<T>`.

## Funcky 1.7.0
* Add nullability annotations to everything except for `Monads.Reader`.
* Add a function for creating an `Option<T>` from a nullable value: `Option.From`.
* `Either.Match` now throws when called on an `Either` value created using `default(Either<L, R>)`.
* Add `True` and `False` functions to public API
* Match of `Result` Monad accepts actions
* Add `FirstOrNone`, `LastOrNone` and `SingleOrNone` extension functions

## Funcky 1.6.0
* Add ToEnumerable function to `Option<T>`.
* Add `WhereSelect` extension function for `IEnumerable<T>`.
* Add missing overload for nullary actions to `ActionToUnit`.
